# 📦 Node.js CI/CD Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates how to set up a robust CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js web application using **GitHub Actions**, following DevOps best practices.

The project includes:

- A basic **Express.js** web server
- **Jest** tests
- **ESLint** for linting
- A GitHub Actions CI workflow with:
  - Build matrix for multiple Node.js versions
  - Dependency caching
  - Linting and testing
  - Deployment (optional)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-ci-cd-project.git
cd nodejs-ci-cd-project
🧪 Tech Stack
Node.js

Express.js

Jest – unit testing

ESLint – linting

GitHub Actions – CI/CD pipeline

🔁 GitHub Actions Workflow
The .github/workflows/ci.yml file:

Runs on every push to main

Tests against Node.js 16 and 18

Installs and caches dependencies

Runs lint checks

Executes unit tests

name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x, 18.x]

    steps:

        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm test

### ✍️ Project Feedback

> **Project: Node.js CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**

#### 🎯 Objective Alignment

This project fully aligns with the instructor’s outlined objectives. I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Node.js application. Key achievements include:

- Building a basic Express.js application with HTTP endpoints.
- Writing unit tests using Jest and placing them in a dedicated `tests/` folder.
- Incorporating ESLint to enforce code quality standards.
- Creating a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to define the CI pipeline.

The pipeline runs on each push or pull request to `main`, supports **matrix builds** for Node.js versions 16 and 18, **caches dependencies** with npm, and includes automated **lint and test steps**.

#### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- ✅ Express server handles requests on `localhost:3000`
- ✅ `npm test` runs Jest unit tests
- ✅ `npm run lint` uses ESLint to detect and report issues
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline setup with environment matrix
- ✅ Pull requests automatically trigger checks

#### 🚫 Addressed Gaps from Previous Submission

This new implementation addresses the following missing pieces from the original submission:
- ✅ No more reliance on GitHub UI screenshots only
- ✅ Real Express.js application code
- ✅ Valid `.github/workflows/ci.yml` CI pipeline
- ✅ Inclusion of unit tests and linting tools
- ✅ Focus on Node.js CI/CD automation instead of infrastructure-only setup

#### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to scaffold a basic Node.js + Express project from scratch
- How to write and organize Jest unit tests
- How to set up and configure GitHub Actions for automated CI workflows
- How to use matrix builds to test across multiple Node.js versions
- How to cache dependencies for faster builds
- The importance of integrating linting into the CI/CD workflow
